# [Hepta](https://github.com/Nereare/Hepta) Change Log

This is the change log to Hepta Project. For further info on this project, see the [ReadMe file](https://github.com/Nereare/Hepta/blob/master/readme.md).

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](http://keepachangelog.com/) and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](http://semver.org/).

Principles of a change log, excerpted from [Keep a Changelog](http://keepachangelog.com/):

* It’s made for humans, not machines, so legibility is crucial.
* Easy to link to any section (hence Markdown over plain text).
* One sub-section per version.
* List releases in reverse-chronological order (newest on top).
* Write all dates in `YYYY-MM-DD` format. (Example: `2012-06-02` for `June 2nd, 2012`.) It’s international, [sensible](http://xkcd.com/1179/), and language-independent.
* Explicitly mention whether the project follows [Semantic Versioning](http://semver.org/).
* Each version should:
  * `List` its release date in the above format.
  * `Group` changes to describe their impact on the project, as follows:
    * `Added` for new features.
    * `Changed` for changes in existing functionality.
    * `Deprecated` for once-stable features removed in upcoming releases.
    * `Removed` for deprecated features removed in this release.
    * `Fixed` for any bug fixes.
    * `Security` to invite users to upgrade in case of vulnerabilities.
